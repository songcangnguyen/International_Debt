# World Bank's International Debt
It's not just individuals who borrow money to met their basic needs, countries also take on debt to manage their economies. For instance, investing in infrastructure is costly requirement for ensuring a comfortable life for a country's citizens. The World Bank is an organization that provides loans to countries. 

For this project, I examine data on international debt collected by The World Bank. The dataset includes details about the debt amount (in USD) owed by developing nations in various categories. I explore and answers questions such as: 
* What is total debt owed by the countries listed in the dataset?
* Which country has highest debt amount, and how much is it?
* What is the average debt owed by countries across different debt indicators?
